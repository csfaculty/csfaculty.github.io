# Schrift
*A clean, elegant and minimalist Jekyll template. Designed for prose.*

## Introduction to the style
I have often tried to design a weblog style that would **focus on the content** and would still be elegant and nice to look at. I don’t pretend I have achieved it yet. But here is my most recent attempt at it. I’m making this template for Jekyll available now. Please use and hack!

## Demo
* **[schrift.nildeala.fr](http://schrift.nildeala.fr)**

## Getting started

1. **Make yourself comfortable**  
Open `_config.yml` and change the settings to your liking. Name, description, menus, (...) are all set in there.

2. **Install dependencies**  
After cloning this repo, make sure you have *bundler* installed (if not, run `gem install bundler`), then:  
```
cd Schrift/
bundle install
```

3. **Run & test**  
You can now use `bundle exec jekyll serve` and `bundle exec jekyll build` to test and compile your blog.

Voilà!
