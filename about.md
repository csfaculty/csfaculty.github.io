One-to-one interviews are an important component of (computer science) faculty job applications, as described in [many excellent job search guides](https://csguides.github.io/grad-job-guide/interviewing/). Many questions applicants might be asked seem to be predictable and can be practiced. The goal of this project is to allow computer science faculty job applicants to practice answering typical questions without requiring an interview partner. The idea is that an applicant reads the current question for herself and responds to it verbally while checking that the answer is not overly long or short. The goal is not to replace practice sessions with real interview partners, which allow for more flexibility, but to provide a simple and complementary way to prepare for them.
